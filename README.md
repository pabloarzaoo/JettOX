## 📂 Folder Structure

```
/project-root
│
├─ firmware/        # BIOS/UEFI logs, microcode events, dxdiag
├─ hardware/        # CPU, GPU, memory, motherboard, logical cores
├─ peripherals/     # USB, Bluetooth, network adapters, PnP devices
├─ storage/         # Disks, partitions, SMART logs, usage stats
├─ system/          # Processes, drivers, Windows event logs
├─ logs/            # Execution logs (timestamps, warnings, errors)
└─ result/          # Aggregated JSON results and summaries
```

* Each folder contains a `summary.json` and `raw.txt` file with parsed and raw outputs.
* Logs include timestamped entries with INFO/WARN/ERROR levels.

## ⚡ How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pabloarzaoo/JettOX/

cd JettOX

# Run the diagnostics
python main.py
```

> 🔑 For full system information and firmware queries, run as **Administrator**.

**Optional Flags & Notes:**

* If `psutil` is not installed, hardware info will be limited.
* SMART disk info requires `smartctl` from Smartmontools.
* Admin privileges are required for full PowerShell and WMIC queries.

## 🔍 Technical Details

JettOX Pro executes diagnostics in five main stages:

1. **Directories & Logging:**

   * Ensures all output folders exist (`firmware`, `hardware`, etc.).
   * Initializes a timestamped log file capturing INFO/WARN/ERROR messages.

2. **Module Execution:**

   * Runs Python functions for each module (`collect_system`, `collect_hardware`, etc.).
   * Uses `subprocess` to run PowerShell and WMIC commands safely.

3. **Parsing & Structuring:**

   * Converts raw command output into structured JSON.
   * Handles CSV parsing for processes and table-like outputs.
   * Includes error handling and fallback messages for missing tools.

4. **Results Aggregation:**

   * Combines all module outputs into `/result/results_of_all_files.json`.
   * Each module folder contains both raw output (`raw.txt`) and summary (`summary.json`).

5. **Terminal Visualization:**

   * Uses Rich library to display progress spinners, panels, and tables.
   * Optional ASCII banner using PyFiglet.
   * Displays elapsed time per module and overall runtime.

## 📊 Detailed Module Breakdown

### System Module

* `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, `driverquery` for Windows environment overview.
* Retrieves top 40 running processes as a sample.
* Collects Windows event logs (`System` and `Application`) for recent errors.

### Hardware Module

* CPU details: Name, cores, frequency (current, min, max).
* Memory details: total and available RAM.
* GPU info using WMIC.
* Optional: psutil provides logical/physical CPU counts.

### Firmware Module

* BIOS/UEFI: Manufacturer, version, release date, serial number.
* Power settings and boot configuration (`powercfg /q`, `bcdedit`).
* DXDiag outputs for DirectX and display info.
* Microcode events collected via PowerShell.

### Storage Module

* Disk drives, partitions, filesystem types, mountpoints.
* Disk usage statistics and optional SMART health checks via `smartctl`.

### Peripherals Module

* USB devices, Bluetooth devices, PnP devices, network adapters.
* Counts number of entries and logs raw outputs for reference.

### Drivers & Services Module

* Lists all installed drivers (`driverquery /v`) and services (`wmic service`).
* Captures errors or warnings if permissions are limited.
